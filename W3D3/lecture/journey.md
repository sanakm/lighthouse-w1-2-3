# The Journey of randomness and OOP?

We were first introduced to math with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Soon after we learned how to count: up 1->2->3 and 3->2->1 down.

We were taught that numbers represented a value... 1 = 1 and 2 = 2
We learned that adding one number to another number created a bigger number & taking a number away from another created a smaller number.
The idea of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division gave us a way to do things with numbers. Create new values from existing values.

#### idea of other characters ? text etc...

But in dealing with numbers we realized when values grew so did our confusion. We needed a way to give a value some sort of descriptive meaning so we could understand what a numerical value represented when we are dealing large quantities of them. After all what are numbers if they don't represent something meaningful to you.

Variables became a way to give values a name

`account_balance = 230.00`

and we used names in place of numbers.

`30 + (45 * 3)` became `caesar_salad + (bacon * 3)`

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that we understand what the numbers mean, we can do meaningful things with them.

In programming we can do things with functions. Functions take argument(s), manipulate them in a meaningful way and return the result of the manipulation.

Above we discussed the idea of addition and subtraction but let's break them down quickly.

`1 + 1 = 2`

is equivalent to `1.+(1) = 2` where *add()* is the function and 1 is the argument. Remember we pass the argument(s) into functions *add(argument)*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we have numbers and ways to do things with them ~
Now we need a way to associate combinations of numbers and things we do with them to names. So we can give meaning to problems that require large combinations of numbers and functions that do things to them.

Classes gave us a way to organize our thoughts & intentions.

Model how our thoughts should communicate with one & other.

We wrote our first programs that did something with data, took some information in from the command line and it was awesome. We were excited to run our ruby program that was safely sitting in a while loop so it would keep on going before you had to kill it.

All of a sudden you start to understand that your program needs to be able save information in order for it to be useful. In order for you to keep coming back.

So you heard about a database
